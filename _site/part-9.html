<p>Day 10? Nope, day 9. The off-day is throwing me off haha. Did you miss me??? I hope you did a little at least. Well, where were we? I was barely in the office today. Instead, I went on TeenWorker field trip! I went to the water and wastewater KUB plants! We got a tours of all of them and they were very cool. We learned a lot of things. Did you know they handle a couple MILLION gallons of water IN A DAY? Also we learn what they do with all the water, it was a very intresting trip. Then, we went for lunch. It was fun being around the other Teenworkers today because I normally don’t see them that much so that was cool. My last hour is coming up! Anthony out! -Anthony</p>
