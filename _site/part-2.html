<p>Anthony’s Adventures Around ISD!
title: Day 2!
date: 2021-06-9
 Today was my second day at KUB. I was mostly at my desk today because my computer is completly fixed. I learned a decent amount today. I began setting up my Workstation setup. No, not my desk. It was all on the computer! I had to download A LOT of apps. It had to be at least 7 apps. It was very diffcult and tricky, but half way done with it. It takes a couple days so I’ll be doing it for a minute. After that, I got started on learning HTML! HTML is basically the building blocks of a website. This is where the words, descriptions, photos, and videos from a website comes from. I also learned some of the basic code for HTML. Once I get more knowledge on HTML, I should be able to code my blog in it! This job is really eye-opening for me I say. I struggled today a bit but everyday isn’t going to be easy and I shouldn’t except it to be either. But still a good day nethertheless! Last hour of work is writing for my blog and it’s slwoing becoming my favorite part of the day. I still gotta learn to end this thing, so see you next time! -Anthony</p>
