<p>title: Day 3!
date:  2021-06-10
—</p>

<p>Today was pretty short. I only worked three hours today!. Since I’m an TeenWorker, I only can work 24 hours a week. So no overtime or things like that. Today, I got back to the WorkStation setup. It was a little easier than yesterday but I still asked Madison some questions. Lastly, I learned some basic commands for Git Bash. I went over a tutorial Madison sent me. She told to watch it and learn as many of the commands as I could. Some I knew and some I didn’t. I’m not finished yet because I had to started my blog! I promised myself I would find how to end of my posts and I think I found something I like! Well I only have an hour left. So Anthony out! Do you like it?? I kinda do and to be honest, that’s the best it’s going to get haha.</p>
