I had a pretty good day today! I finally fixed my calculator! It took about an hour a half to fix it but every minute was worth it in my opinion. It only adds for now but will be updated in the future! My next practice presentation is coming in a few days and I think I'm ready for it. I worked on it a ton. Do you remember that pull request I made for KUB? It went live today! Even though it was just little grammar fix, I'm pretty proud of it. So if you get a email for aplliance installation, Thats my fix! Anthony out! -Anthony
