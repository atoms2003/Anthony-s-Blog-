Today's my last day... I'm really going to miss it here. Everyone here were so great and wonderful to work with. They have taught me things I'll never forget. I will be back, I can promise that. To the TeenWorker program, thank you for everything. I'll always remember this experiece. My last shift is coming to a close. Thank you for reading. Anthony out! -Anthony
