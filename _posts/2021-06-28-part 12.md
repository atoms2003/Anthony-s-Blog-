Hi! It's Anthony. Today was a day actually. I woke up and was ready for work and then all of a sudden, a headache. My head was literally pounding but I powered through the day and got everything I need to get done finished. Then I had lunch and the drink I brought spilled in inside my lunch bag. Had to throw away the food. My day wasn't looking good by then but it good better. Today might been one of my worst days but I still pulled through and I'm glad I did. Well my last hour is coming up, Anthony out! -Anthony
