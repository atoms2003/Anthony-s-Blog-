Hello. Again. :) I wasn't in the office that much to be honest with you. I had a training session today with the other TeenWorkers! It was a intro to natural gas. We learned how KUB gets their gas to customers and how they fix issues in their department. We got to see their equiment and everything. It was a nice little session. I'm still working on my presentation for the end of the summer. Just learned it's five minutes so had to cut it down. Welp, thats all from me! Anthony out! -Anthony
