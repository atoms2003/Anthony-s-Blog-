YO! I'm back... again. Day 7! It was a pretty chill and cool day. My blog site is techinally finished! It took over 4 days but me and Madison thinks it runs smoothly. I hope it stays that way. Because this was actually pretty diffcult. I always thought making a website was just simple as putting a few things in but it was a whole process. But the people around the office always jumped on the chance to help me and I'm very grateful for that. My blog links now work and now have a theme attached to it! The theme might change, I haven't decided yet. That's it from me! Anthony out! -Anthony
