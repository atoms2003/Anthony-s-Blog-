Hi everyone. Today, I had another TeenWorker activity. I got to talk to many other department managers and ask them questions about KUB, colleges, their jobs, etc. It was a really nice experience and kinda wished we could've talked to them longer haha. Then we shot a video for the TeenWorker program so they can show future TeenWorkers. It was really fun because we were really just talking the whole because the video is not going to have audio. I took on the path they have outside the building. It was was a nice and long walk. Well, My shift is about to end it. Next time, I should have photos with my blog! Anthony out! -Anthony
