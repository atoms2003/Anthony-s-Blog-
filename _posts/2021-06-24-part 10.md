Hello! You know who this is it. Day 10. A thing that has improved dramaticly is my typing! I've always typed somewhat fast but now I feel like I'm writing faster and faster everyday. Today was CSS day. Coding CSS is a little challenging for me to be honest. I knew it wasnt be easy but this was not what I was expecing. This might take some time but I think I can get it. CSS is adding things to my website. How the font looks, where the links are, and how big or small the page is. I still haven't wrapped my head around it yet so my definition may be a little off. Madison told me look at some tutorials and they were helpful but I couldn't showcase it that much. I'm going to keep on it and hope for some improvement. Last 30 minutes of my shift is coming up. Anthony out! -Anthony
