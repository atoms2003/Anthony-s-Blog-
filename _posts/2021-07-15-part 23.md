Another short day! I really only worked on my presentation. It's almost done and I hope it's good. I'm only going to have 5 minutes so I'll have to make them count! Zach, One of the workers in ISD are leaving today. :( We had a pizza party for him and it was really nice. Everyone is sad to see him to go but I wish the best for him for his future! Well, that's all for today. Anthony out! -Anthony
