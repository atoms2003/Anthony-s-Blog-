Hi. It's me. Another short day! Today I brainstromed a lot of ideas to edit and improve my blog. Some worked and others didn't but I'm still looking. Madison said she'll help me with any improvements and really glad for that haha. I hope I can do it without breaking the website again! I also got my light! I kinda felt left out because everyone else had one so I wanted it haha. It's really cool! The last 10 minutes of my shift are here. Anthony out! -Anthony
