YO! It's me... again. I have mastered the art of images! Ok but my images are now on my blog! There aren't many but there will be more in the future, I can promise that. Other than that, I had a good day. I had a scare I deleted all of my work today but the great thing about computers is backing it up. I've deleted many things before and the computer always saving my work and making sure everything is recoverable. And I'm glad for that haha. My last few mintues are here unfortunately so Anthony out! -Anthony
