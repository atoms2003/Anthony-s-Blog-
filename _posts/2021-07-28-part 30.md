Hi! I had a TeenWorker End of Summer presentation! I wasn't nervous before but when I got up there... I'm might of stuttered a little. But everyone told me how much they enjoyed it! Friday is my last day. It's so sad!!! Because this was actually my first real job and it'll be really upsetting to leave. Madison and some others are taking me to eat for my last day. :) It will be really fun. Well my shift is coming to an end. Anthony out! -Anthony
