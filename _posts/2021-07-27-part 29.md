Hello! It's me once again. I had my pratice presentation today. It went really well! I got a ton of tips and ideas to make my presentation better and really appreciated all the help from the people watching. Thank you Alivia and Madison! The real thing is tomorrow and I'm ready to kill it. End of shift! Anthony out! -Anthony
