Hello everyone. It's my last week here. I know, it's really sad but I've really enjoyed my time here! They have taught me things I'll never forget. Today was back to Java and I struggled quite a bit. Madison reminded me that struggling is how you learned with programming. You try to fix something and it might take a while, but you feel accomplished when you figure it out. This job hasn't been the easier and I've run into a lot of walls haha. But, the important thing is that I'm learning and keep learning. My shift is almost over. Anthony out! -Anthony
