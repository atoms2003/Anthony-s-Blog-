Hello everyone. Today was a ok day. The more and more I'm here, the more I have to problem slove. I usually don't have a problem with it but this coding thing is testing me. I'm trying my best but I still feel like I'm lacking at some things. I know I'm not expected to know everything, but not being able to fix something is really starting to irk me. But, I'm glad I'm doing this job because it gives me the insight I need. This job is diffcult but I like it. Some days, I feel great but others I feel lacking. I plan to get better at this and hoping to succed in that haha. Well, my shift is coming to a end. Anthony out! -Anthony
