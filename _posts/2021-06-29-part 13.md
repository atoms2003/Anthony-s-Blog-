title: Day 13!

Hello everyone! Today was a better day. My lunch was still intact and my headache has gone away. This day just felt more productive for me. I did my first request for KUB. Now, techinally I've already done pull requests before but this one will be for a offical KUB website! It was just something I though could be a bit better. It's not that flashy but I'm proud of it haha. I did get stuck a little today but it's kinda normal at this point haha. I somewhat fixed my issue but might be more underlying problem but I have 30 minutes on my shift so that's a tomorrow problem... Anthony out! -Anthony
