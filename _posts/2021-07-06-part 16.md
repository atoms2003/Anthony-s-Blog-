Hi everyone! It's Anthony. Of course it's Anthony, who else would it be? I had my first four-day weekend because of 4th of July. I didn't get paid for it unfortunately but it's fine! I made some more updates to my blog. Can you guess what it is? Drumroll... IMAGES! I know, not that exciting but it's a a big step for me. Another thing to add to my coding skills. My last 30 minutes of my shift is coming up. Anthony Out! -Anthony
