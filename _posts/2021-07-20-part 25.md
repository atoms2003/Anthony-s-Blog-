title: Day 25!

Today was a okay day at best. I'm picking up where I left off on JavaScript and I still struggling a bit. I tried to make a calculator today and it didn't go as planned. I still have some issues with it right now but I'm going to keep up with it! JavaScript is way more complex than HTML and CSS. It has a lot of underlying things you have to do to make it run properly but I'll get there. My time is up today! Anthony out! -Anthony
