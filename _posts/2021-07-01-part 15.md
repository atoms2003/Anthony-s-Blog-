Hello! My blog has has been coming along nicely. I'm adding new things but they arent quite done yet. But you will see them soon! My day was short today so to be honest I don't have much to write about today> I took another walk on the trail today with some other TeenWorkers. It was really nice and fun! I promise to update you more on the blog and I'm still learning now things everyday. Anthony out! -Anthony
