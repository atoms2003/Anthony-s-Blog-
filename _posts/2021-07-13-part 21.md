Hi. It's me. Again. Today I started on my powerpoint to show my time at the end of summer job! I can't believe it's almost over. I've been having a lot of fun at this job, and it's been teaching me a lot. I'm very very glad I got this chance to work here, and I always appreciate the people here teaching me along the way. I hope I can finish up with all the knowledge that will be helpful for college. My shift is coming to a end. Anthony out! -Anthony
