Hello again! I had a pretty nice day today. I have been reading about Java, not JavaScript. It's has a lot more requirements than Java. It's called a strict language so pretty much you have program everything and tell everything what to do. Which is different from JavaScript because it will allow to write whatever you want haha. My day is coming to a end. Until we meet again, Anthony out! -Anthony
