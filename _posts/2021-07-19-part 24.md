Hello! It's me. I had a test presentation for my end of summer PowerPoint. I messed up a little but most of it went very well. I think this presentation will go very well. My last day is in a week and it's very sad. :( but I've had a great time! I'm thinking of returning in my freshmen year of college but I'm still on the fence about it. I know I could probably do it but I'm a little scared. But, I want to make use of this opportunity so maybe I'll own up to the challenge. Well, my last few minutes for up. Anthony out! -Anthony
