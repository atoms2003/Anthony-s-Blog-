It's me... Today was a day haha. It was a little frustrating not gonna lie. My website is up and running as you remember, but I still needed a theme for it. You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find one. Then, when I found one I liked... and IT DOESN'T WORK. But I settled on one eventually, don't like as it as much as the other one but it'll do for now. Also did you know a layout and theme are two different things? It took me a minute to learn the diffence, but I think I understand it now... I hope haha. Well my last hour of work apporoaches. I won't have a entry tommorow because I won't be here but I'll be back Wednesday, I promise! Anthony out! -Anthony
