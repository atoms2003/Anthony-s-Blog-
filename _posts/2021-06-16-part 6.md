title: Day 6!
date:  2021-06-16

Hi. Did you miss me?? It's the sixth day in the ISD department. I successed and falied somewhat today. Coding my blog is going okay. Good news is everything is coming at great! The bad news is I can't put a theme on it. So, it might stay plain white for a couple days. We're troubleshooting now but no luck. The day has hasn't been all day though! My blog is complete... somewhat. The site is still a little buggy, but everything else is working fine. I got my second monitor working! I always had it at my desk but I didn't know how to set it up. But, I got it now! It's pretty cool. Next, I might get a light to show I'm in a meeting. I don't know why, maybe because everyone else in the office has one so I want one haha. Well, the last hour of work is almost over. Anthony out! Oh yeah, that's gonna stick! -Anthony
