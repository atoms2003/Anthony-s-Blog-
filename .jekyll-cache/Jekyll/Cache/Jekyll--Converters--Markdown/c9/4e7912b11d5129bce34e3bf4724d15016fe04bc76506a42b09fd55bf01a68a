<p>Hi guys! It’s Anthony! So day 5 aready… time flies. I progessed WAY MORE than usual today. I have learned more coding to get my site up and functional as possible. It’s been really fun! At first, I thought I wouldn’t be able be put up coding. And to my suprise… I’m actually getting it. Yeah, there are some hiccups here and there but for the most point, I’m learning pretty quickly. I can’t wait to make my blog site. The more I learn, the more I can cumstomize the site! It’s not even half done yet but I’m getting closer to it everyday. And that’s it for today. Anthony out! Ok, admit it… DO YOU LIKE IT OR NOT? -Anthony</p>
