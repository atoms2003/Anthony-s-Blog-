<p>My second week at KUB begins! Today was mostly spent on this blog! I learned to how to set the website so I can put all my entries on it. I hit a wall but I’m gonna keep on it! I had a lot of help today. The people here are very helpful even when they think they can’t help me much. It’s a big relief because I know I have people that can lead me a hand. Ok, that wraps it up! Anthony out! Still not used to that yet… -Anthony</p>
